Skippr
======

Skippr is a file sharing service deployed as a web app,
routing each file transfer through the HOPR network

User Interface
==============
The UI as of this commit is a work in progress, partially incomplete and 
subject to change.
It aims to resemble a post office, run by a mascot (frog) called skipper or
 whatever else emerges out in future versions. That is of course an element of marketing.
The sheet of paper (html form) that emerges from the main page header is a proof of concept and not properly layed out yet.

The Backend
===========
Thought need to be put into structuring the payment system of the service.
If the service is not supposed to be paid that need to be explained to me by the HOPR members.
