Foo Share
=========

This is a web application using the HOPR network
<M-o>

Foo Share is written in pure javascript, working closely with the browser.
A dataURL is sent over the network which is the native format for file downloads
in all browsers.

The stylesheets are sleek

All state is maintained in the top level `full_folder` div element.
Style is applied to children based on that state.

I am a proponent of web minimalism and I feel like this poses as a great example





TODO:
	* Implement multiple file sharing
	* Improve support for small screens
	* 
	* 

It is preferable that the HOPR protocol is extended to handle files
